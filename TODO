GOAL: An operating system that should be able to run across several nodes(physical machines/virtual machines)
which can spawn LXC containers across the nodes and store all the metadata over the cluster. 

This will help people to host modern day datacentre with resource saving. For organisations who run several
projects, can host each of the project in the containers.

Micro Architecture:

1. Install the base/host (Ubuntu - 14.04) on two hosts/ec2 instances.
2. Have a service discovery, key valus store setup on them
3. Start an LXC container in one of the host for each of the project.(PHP/Rails/Python/Any webapp)
4. Provision a vhost on the base/host which points to the internal ip of the container.
5. HAve a vhost inside the container which serves the code.
6. Use configuration management system to setup needed software/custom drivers in the containers.
7. Ability to destroy the entire container and all its redirection pointers from the host.
8. Store container attributes like hostname, ip address, etc. in the key value store.
9. Route ssh traffic to the container based on hostname (fqdn)
